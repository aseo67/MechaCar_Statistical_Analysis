## Overview of Analysis
AutosRUs has a new prototype, the MechaCar, which is facing production troubles. AutosRUs would like to review the production data for any insights to help the manufacturing team. This analysis:
- Performs a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables that predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collects summary statistics on the PSI (pounds per square inch) of suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Runs t-tests to see if manufacturing lots are statistically different from mean population
- Designs a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of MechaCars vs. other manufacturers' vehicles

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
write a short summary using a screenshot of  output from the linear regression,  address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
